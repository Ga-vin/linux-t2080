* Freescale Display Interface Unit

The Freescale DIU is a LCD controller, with proper hardware, it can also
drive DVI monitors.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "fsl,diu" or "fsl,mpc5121-diu".
- reg : should contain at least address and length of the DIU register
  set. The address and length for pixel clock register is optional, it's
  not needed for the platforms with the pixel clock setting function, such
  as P1022, MPC8610, MPC5121; for the platform without clock setting function,
  the pixel clock register and settings in 'pixclk' node work together to
  provide the pixel clock setting in the diu driver.
- interrupts : one DIU interrupt should be described here.
- interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that
  services interrupts for this device.

Optional properties:
- edid : verbatim EDID data block describing attached display.
  Data from the detailed timing descriptor will be used to
  program the display controller.
- pixclk : the pixel clock register setting, includeing PXCKDLYDIR, PXCK
  and PXCKDLY.

Example (MPC8610HPCD):
	display@2c000 {
		compatible = "fsl,diu";
		reg = <0x2c000 100>;
		interrupts = <72 2>;
		interrupt-parent = <&mpic>;
	};

Example for MPC5121:
	display@2100 {
		compatible = "fsl,mpc5121-diu";
		reg = <0x2100 0x100>;
		interrupts = <64 0x8>;
		interrupt-parent = <&ipic>;
		edid = [edid-data];
	};

Example for T1040:
	display:display@180000 {
		compatible = "fsl,t1040-diu", "fsl,diu";
		reg = <0x180000 1000 0xfc028 4>;
		pixclk = <0 255 0>;
		interrupts = <74 2 0 0>;
	};
